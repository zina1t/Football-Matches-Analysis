### Instructions
Perform an appropriate hypothesis test to determine the p-value, and hence result, of whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's. Use a **10% significance level**.

For this analysis, you'll use Official **FIFA World Cup** matches since **2002-01-01**, and you'll also assume that each match is fully independent, i.e., team form is ignored.

The p-value and the result of the test must be stored in a dictionary called **result_dict** in the form:

**result_dict = {"p_val": p_val, "result": result}**

where **p_val** is the p-value and result is either the string **"fail to reject"** or **"reject"**, depending on the result of the test.
